## Installation

### Dependecies

```
sudo apt install python3-distutils
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3-dev libkrb5-dev gcc
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

### Synapse user
Before filling in the configuration file, create a new user in TheHive for Synapse with the following details:

```
Login:                     synapse
Full name:                 synapse
Roles:                     read, write
Additional Permissions:    âœ“ Allow alerts creation
```

And create an API Key.   

Now edit the configuration file located at ```Synapse/conf/synapse.conf```.

### [api] section

The ```[api]``` section is related to the flask API settings. You can keep it as it is for ```debug```, ```host```, ```threaded``` value. You may want to change the default port ```5000```.

#### Example

```
[api]
debug:False
host:0.0.0.0
port:5000
threaded:True
```

### [TheHive] section

In this section, put in TheHive's url and the API Key previously created.

#### Example

```
[TheHive]
url:http://127.0.0.1:9000
user:synapse
api_key:r4n0O8SvEll/VZdOD8r0hZneOWfOmth6
```

Basic configuration for Synapse is done.   
To configure workflows, head to the [workflows page](workflows/README.md).

## Start the app

To start Synapse, run:

```
python3 app.py
```

## Deployment to Production

If you'd like to go live with Synapse, it is advised to use a WSGI server.
The below will show you how to deploy Synapse as a service with gunicorn and supervisor but feel free to use any others tools for your deployment.

This part is mainly taken from the excellent [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xvii-deployment-on-linux-even-on-the-raspberry-pi) by Miguel Grinberg. 
Have a look at the section named "Setting Up Gunicorn and Supervisor" for the "original" deployment instructions.

### Instructions

 * Download the WSGI server and the process control system:

```
sudo apt-get install gunicorn3
sudo apt-get install supervisor
```

 * Create the user ```synapse```, this user is dedicated to running the application.

```
sudo adduser --disabled-login synapse
```

 * Create ```/etc/supervisor/conf.d/synapse.conf``` as follow:

```
[program:synapse]
command=/usr/bin/gunicorn3 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 -w 4 app:app
directory=/opt/Synapse
user=synapse
environment=REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE="<PATH_TO_EWS_CERT>"
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
```

In this case, Synapse is located at ```/opt/Synapse``` as indicated by ```directory=/opt/Synapse```.
Feel free to adapt ```directory``` to your context.   
Just make sure that user ```synapse``` has enough rights on this directory:

```
sudo chown -R synapse:synapse /opt/Synapse/
```

**Make also sure to replace ```<PATH_TO_EWS_CERT>``` with the file path to your ews certificate.**

 * Reload supervisor to make the changes effective:

```
sudo supervisorctl reload
```

From here the application should be deployed and running on port 5000.
It also means that your server has now port 5000 **open**.

### Stopping the application

To stop Synapse, run:

```
sudo supervisorctl stop synapse
```

### Starting the application

To start Synapse, run:

```
sudo supervisorctl start synapse
```

### Logs

Logs for supervisor are located under:

```
/var/log/supervisor/
```

Regarding Synapse, if the application is located at ```/opt``` then logs are under:

```
/opt/Synapse/logs/
```

# Update

In order to update Synapse (minor version), just pull the new version from Github and run the application:

```
cd Synapse/
git pull
```
