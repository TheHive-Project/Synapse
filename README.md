Synapse is a free, open source meta alert feeder that allows you to feed [TheHive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive) from multiple alert sources at once.   
It leverages TheHive's API to automate case and alert creation. Thanks to Synapse, you can swiftly create cases or alerts in TheHive out of email notifications or SIEM events.

Currently, Synapse supports the following alert sources:

- Microsoft Exchange
- Microsoft O365
- IBM QRadar

# Overview

Most of the time, transforming a security event or a notification about a suspicious email requires several actions and conditions.  Synapse gathers those into workflows.   

In order to have the most user-friendly application possible, we decided to put an API on top of these workflows.   That way, you would only execute the workflow you are interested in by "hitting" the corresponding API endpoint.   

The following workflows are currently supported by Synapse:
   * Case creation from email using Exchange Web Service & O365
   * Alert creation from QRadar offenses

![](docs/img/big-picture.png)

For a detailed explanation of each workflow,  please have a look at the [workflows page](docs/workflows/README.md).   

# Using Synapse

The [user guide](docs/user_guide.md) should contain all the information you need. In short:

   1. Install dependencies
   2. Fill in the config file
   3. Execute: ```python3 app.py```

While all operating systems running Python 3 can be used for Synapse, we recommend the use of Ubuntu.   

# Running in Docker

   1. Build Image: ```docker build -t synapse .```
   2. Run Container: ```docker run -d --name synapse -p 5000:5000 synapse```
   
   You can also mount the config file for easier adjustments
   ```docker run -d --name synapse -v ${pwd}/conf/synapse.conf:/opt/synapse/conf/synapse.conf -p 5000:5000 synapse```
